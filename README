Project Description: Introduction To Animation with SDL

The Specs that I implemented: All
Extras: I have made the background as sprite with velociy 0,0 and start location 0,0
The tag backgroundin game.xml corresponds to that.
The xml tag that corresponds to flying sprites is football. The number of sprites to
be displayed is in the number xml tag with this football tag.
With Dr. Malloy's permission permission I am resubmitting my project today, i.e. on 
29th Sept and he said that he won't be pinalizing me for that.
